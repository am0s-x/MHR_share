System requirements:
------------------------------------------------
- Computer running Windows 7 or newer
- .Net Framework 4.7.2 or newer
- Internet Explorer 11
- Internet connection


Instructions:
------------------------------------------------
1. Download and open "MHR.exe" (the application)
2. Once it is loaded, enter the appropriate site #
3. Enter card number
4. Double check the side # and card # are correct
5. Hit the "Run" button
6. Wait until the automated processes complete.
(The application will launch two IE windows, open the registration and the email website, fill in all necessary registration info, check for a confirmation email, click the confirmation link, close all IE windows upon successful registration.)
7. Repeat steps 2 to 6.


Cautions:
------------------------------------------------
- I am not a programmer, so the application is only usable and far from flawless.
- Using a VPN is recommended, the husky site will ban IP addresses if they detect too much registration from the same IP.
- Do not manually close any IE windows during each automated registration process.
- It is normal that the application appears stuck (not responding) during an automated process.
- In case the application quitted/stopped accidentally, open the Task Manager (right-click the taskbar then click Task Manager), then close any related processes and all remaining IE windows.
- If the husky site indicates that the email domain is not allowed, please manually open email-fake.com, select a new email domain (something looks like "@fakedomain.com"), copy-paste it into the application, close the application and re-run the automated registration processes.
