System requirements:
------------------------------------------------
- Internet connection
- Computer running Windows 10
- Internet Explorer 11
- .Net Framework 4.7.2


Instructions:
------------------------------------------------
1. Download "MHR.exe" (the application) https://github.com/am0s-x/MHR_share/raw/main/MHR.zip
2. Open the application, it might take a while to be loaded
3. Once it is loaded, enter the appropriate site #
4. Enter card number
5. Double check the side # and card # are correct
6. Hit the "Run" button
7. Wait until the automated processes complete.
(The application will launch two IE windows, open the registration and the email website, fill in all necessary registration info, check for a confirmation email, click the confirmation link, close all IE windows upon successful registration.)
8. Repeat steps 3 to 7.


Cautions:
------------------------------------------------
- I am not a programmer, the application is far from flawless, so it may crash unexpectedly for some reason.
- Using a VPN is recommended, the husky site will ban IP addresses if they detect too much registration from the same IP.
- Do not manually close any IE windows during each automated registration process.
- It is normal that the application appears stuck (not responding) during an automated process.
- In case the application quitted/stopped accidentally, open the Task Manager (right-click the taskbar then click Task Manager), then close any related processes (e.g. MHR.exe) and all remaining IE windows.
- If the husky site indicates that the email domain is not allowed, please manually open email-fake.com, select a new email domain (something looks like "@fakedomain.com"), copy-paste it into the application, close the application and re-run the automated registration processes.
- Sometimes the husky site takes a long time to respond, so you may need to click the Submit button manually in case it happens.
